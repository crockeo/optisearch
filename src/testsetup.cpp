// Note to random developer, 2nd edition,
//
// Hi Randev,
//  On the docs for Catch it said that to optimize compile time for writing new
//  tests one should have a file to have the "#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN" &
/// "#include "catch.hpp"", and the rest to have the actual test cases.

//////////////////////
// Setting Up Catch //
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN
#include "catch.hpp"
